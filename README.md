##DESCRIPTION##

This is a improved version of CHAP Links Network Timeline. This part of work is Sponsored by [www.xperiment.mobi](http://www.xperiment.mobi)

The Timeline is an interactive visualization chart to visualize events in time. 
The events can take place on a single date, or have a start and end date 
(a range). You can freely move and zoom in the timeline by dragging and 
scrolling in the Timeline. Events can be created, edited, and deleted in the 
timeline. The time scale on the axis is adjusted automatically, and supports 
scales ranging from milliseconds to years.

When the timeline is defined as editable, events can be moved to another time 
by dragging them. By double clicking, the contents of an event can be changed. 
An event can be deleted by clicking the delete button on the upper right. A new 
event can be added in different ways: by double clicking in the timeline, or by 
keeping the Ctrl key down and clicking or dragging in the timeline, or by 
clicking the add button in the upper left of the timeline, and then clicking or 
dragging at the right location in the timeline.

The Timeline is developed as a Google Visualization Chart in javascript. It 
runs in every browser without additional requirements. There is a GWT wrapper 
available to use the Timeline in GWT (Google Web Toolkit), you can find relevant 
documentation here.

The Timeline is designed to display up to 100 events smoothly on any modern 
browser.
